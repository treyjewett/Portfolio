                    <!-- A quick bio to introduce myself and why I chose to persue a full-stack certification. -->
                    <p>Raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, I have remained close to home and I now live in Dallas, North Carolina. I graduated from UNC Charlotte in 2017 after 
                        obtaining a bachelors degree in exercise physiology. I currently work for a research and development facility where knowledge regarding technology is required. 
                        I am attending UNC Charlotte's coding boot camp in an attempt to further my understanding of applications and how to apply them to my line of work.
                        When I was younger, I had always wanted to be an engineer. Playing sports throughout my childhood really gave me a passion for physiology, which is why 
                        I chose to study that in college. Soon after graduating, I realized that the field was not for me and I have been in engineering ever since. Having worked
                        in the field for over 3 years, I gravitated towards technology. It quickly became apparent that I needed some education in the "behind-the-scenes" systems
                        that help technology perform. After nearly 18 months of teaching myself Python, I realized that I needed a strong foundation in order to build my education
                        efficiently. After the bootcamp, I want to utilize my education to advance machine learning and other AI applications.
