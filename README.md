# Portfolio

## The Project

As an aspiring developer, it is crucial that my skills are put on display for potential employers to see my work. One of the best ways to do that is to create a website that show-cases projects that took the most skill, or something that stands out among others. Herein lies the project: Create a website that houses skills learned through the UNC Charlotte Bootcamp so that employers will have a good idea of what I am capable of.

## Code Utilized

This portfolio was made ustilizing HTML and CSS. Pseudo elements were used to aid in some of of the effects on the list items and work images. Media queries were utilized to help create a responsive layout.

## What To Expect

When the portfolio is loaded:
- A header presents my name as well as navigation for the page.
- The navigation buttons will scroll to the respective section on the page when clicked.
- The first section is a small bio about myself and why I am persuing development.
- The following section shows interactive tiles that show applications and web pages that I have created.
- The application that stands out the most is my most recent project and is listed first and larger than the others.
- All of the application tiles are links to the published work. If I have not yet completed the project, it navigates to my github page.
- When the screen is re-sized, the content on the page reacts appropriately so it is readable on various devices and screen sizes.
- All contact information (with the exception of the phone number) has links that navigate to the contact type for easier communication.

## Lessons Learned

Creating a website from scratch is no easy task, even when the website is about myself. I learned that CSS is much more powerful than I had previously thought. Labeling plays a very important role, as well as good commenting. I had labeled a few sections carelessly, and I was forced to change those to more appropriate names for the sake of editing. Commenting is a great help, especially when experimenting with a new styling technique. It helps you know what you are trying to edit and where you are in your page. Without the use of comments, I found myself searching for minutes on end just what code I was working on. All in all, clean code writing as well as continued documentation is essential to an efficient project.
